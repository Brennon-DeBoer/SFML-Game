# SFML-Game
Readme File for SFML Game

Contributors: Brennon DeBoer

Description of Program: This program uses a combination of C++ and SFML to create a spaceship shooter game. The objective of the game is to shoot down as many enemy ships before you lose all of your health points.

Roadmap: Need to add some more efficiency. Try to implement more functions to decrease the length of the main function.
